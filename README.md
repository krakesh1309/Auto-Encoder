## Movie Rating Autoencoder

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an autoencoder for movie ratings. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, denoising, or feature learning. In this case, the autoencoder is trained on movie ratings data to learn a compressed representation of user preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie ratings provided by users. Each row in the dataset represents a user's rating for a particular movie. The ratings are typically integers ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the lowest rating and 5 indicates the highest rating.

## Architecture

The autoencoder architecture used in this project consists of two main parts: an encoder and a decoder.

**Encoder**: The encoder takes the movie ratings as input and compresses them into a lower-dimensional representation, capturing the essential features of the ratings.

**Decoder**: The decoder takes the compressed representation generated by the encoder and reconstructs the original movie ratings from it.

The goal of training the autoencoder is to minimize the difference between the input ratings and the reconstructed ratings, encouraging the model to learn a meaningful representation of the data.

## Training
The autoencoder is trained using a dataset of movie ratings. The training process involves minimizing a loss function that measures the dissimilarity between the input ratings and the reconstructed ratings. This is typically done using gradient-based optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

## Evaluation
The performance of the autoencoder can be evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) between the input ratings and the reconstructed ratings, or by visually inspecting the quality of the reconstructed ratings compared to the original ratings.

## Usage
